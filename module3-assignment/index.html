                Looking back on a childhood filled with events and memories, 
                I find it rather difficult to pick one that leaves me with the 
                fabled "warm and fuzzy feelings." As the daughter of an Air Force 
                major, I had the pleasure of traveling across America in many 
                moving trips. I have visited the monstrous trees of the Sequoia
                 National Forest, stood on the edge of the Grand Canyon and have 
                 jumped on the beds at Caesar's Palace in Lake Tahoe. The day 
                 I picked my dog up from the pound was one of the happiest days
                  of both of our lives. I had gone to the pound just a week earlier 
                  with the idea that I would just "look" at a puppy. Of course, 
                  you can no more just look at those squiggling little faces so 
                  filled with hope and joy than you can stop the sun from setting 
                  in the evening. I knew within minutes of walking in the door that
                   I would get a puppy… but it wasn't until I saw him that I knew 
                   I had found my puppy. Looking for houses was supposed to be a 
                   fun and exciting process. Unfortunately, none of the ones that
                    we saw seemed to match the specifications that we had 
                    established. They were too small, too impersonal, 
                    too close to the neighbors. After days of finding nothing 
                    even close, we began to wonder: was there really a perfect 
                    house out there for us?
